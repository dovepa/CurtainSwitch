## Mechanical Design

The mechanical design of the theater curtain was created using Fusion 360, a powerful 3D design software. This design includes all the necessary components to make the curtain move smoothly and reliably.

## Code Implementation

The code was written to control the movement of the theater curtain using ESP8266 and WemosD1 microcontrollers. The code takes care of controlling the movement of the curtain, as well as handling any errors or malfunctions.

## How to Use

To use this project, simply upload the code to the ESP8266 or WemosD1 microcontroller and connect the necessary components according to the schematic provided. The code should run automatically, and the curtain should begin moving.

## Conclusion

This motorized theater curtain project provides a reliable and efficient solution for controlling the movement of theater curtains. With its advanced mechanical design and well-implemented code, this project is a great example of the potential of using microcontrollers in theater applications.
